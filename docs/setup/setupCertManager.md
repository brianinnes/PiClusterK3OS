# Certificate Manager

The certificate manager will issue certificates as needed by the cluster

To install the certificate manager follow the instructions:

```
kubectl create namespace cert-manager
kubectl apply --validate=false -f https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/download/v0.14.0/cert-manager.yaml
kubectl apply -f manifests/certManager/certManager_clusterIssuer.yaml
```

To get the certificate generated by the cert-manager use the following:

```bash
openssl s_client -connect registry.bik8s.home:443 -showcerts </dev/null 2>/dev/null|openssl x509 -outform PEM >mycertfile.pem
```

replacing registry.bik8s.home with the hostname
