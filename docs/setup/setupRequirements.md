## Software

On your laptop or workstation you need the following software installed:

- kubectl - See [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl) for steps
- openssl
- Helm v3

You need to have ssh keys for generated on your workstation, which you will add to the K3OS nodes, so you can ssh in to them.  If you don't already have keys you can find instructions [here](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/keygen) or if you use putty the instructions can be found [here](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/putty/windows/puttygen)

You also need to have a Docker account to be able to access and push images to dockerhub.
